	abstract = {The global surge in pharmaceutical consumption, driven by increasing population and the demand for animal proteins, leads to the discharge of diverse pollutants, including antibiotic residues, into water bodies. Sulfonamides, being water-soluble compounds, can readily enter surface run-off, posing potential risks to non-target species despite their low environmental concentrations. Latin America has implemented intensive production systems highly dependent on antimicrobials for productivity and animal health, yet there is a paucity of information regarding their concentration in the region. The objective of this study was to evaluate the presence of sulfonamides in water and sediment samples and assess their potential ecological risks through an environmental risk assessment. The Río de la Plata basin collects the waters of the Paraguay, Paraná, and Uruguay rivers, together with their tributaries and various wetlands, passing through the provinces in Argentina known for their significant animal husbandry production. Two sampling campaigns were carried out for sediment, while only one campaign was conducted for surface waters. The samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). None of the examined sulfonamide antibiotics were detected in the sediment samples from both sampling campaigns. In contrast, sulfadiazine (95 %), sulfamethoxazole (91 %), and sulfathiazole (73 %) were detected in the water samples. Sulfadiazine was found in the concentration range of 8 to 128 ng/L, while sulfamethoxazole and sulfathiazole were observed at concentrations ranging from 3.0 to 32.5 ng/L and 2.9 to 8.1 ng/L, respectively. Based on the environmental risk assessment conducted using the sulfonamide concentrations, most samples indicated a medium risk for aquatic biota, with only one sample surpassing the high-risk threshold. This study represents the first report presenting data on the presence of sulfonamide antibiotics in the aquatic environment of Argentina.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the amount of wastewater–containing pharmaceutical contaminants that are released into the environment from hospitals, pharmaceutical industry, and aquaculture sector has significantly increased. In fact, it has become a real issue due to the excessive uses of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), fast urbanization, medical sector development, and the progress in the anthropogenic activities which directly polluted water. In this context, many efforts have been made in order to effectively remediate wastewater–containing pharmaceutical contaminants employing several processes (i.e., adsorption, biological remediation, membrane separation, electrochemical treatments, photocatalysis, flocculation, coagulation processes, etc.). Even though the mentioned processes present numerous benefits in the remediation of wastewater–containing active pharmaceutical ingredients, efficient feedstocks must be developed to achieve sustainability goals in wastewater remediation purposes. In order to attain such objectives, carbon quantum dots (CQDs) nanomaterials have attracted the attention of scientists and industrialists in pharmaceutical contaminants degradation due to their stronger fluorescence with high quantum yields in the low–energy region, synergetic effect, nontoxic, simple functionalization, tunable emission wavelength, etc. Herein, we review the recent developments made in CQDs–based Z/S–heterojunctions as high–efficient feedstocks for pharmaceutical contaminants degradation utilizing the photocatalysis process. The main sources of CQDs are also described. The limitations and benefits of the studied process are outlined. In the future research work, new sources of CQDs must be manufactured and advanced processes should be applied in the field of wastewater–containing active pharmaceutical ingredients remediation employing CQDs as organic feedstocks which present a new trend in nano–materials synthesis and their usages for pharmaceutical pollutants abatement.},

	abstract = {Rapid population growth and increasing demand for animal protein food have led to a continuous increase in global utilization of antibiotic. Sulfonamides (SAs) are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and pose an ecological risk owing to their large consumption and strong environmental persistence. Hence, this review focuses on the recent publications on 12 different SAs and provides a detailed summary of selected antibiotic concentrations in various water systems. We evaluated the ecotoxicity of SAs on organisms at different trophic level organisms and the environmental risks regarding aquatic systems. The results indicated that SA antibiotics were ubiquitous in aquatic environments at concentrations ranging from ng/L to μg/L. According to the data using standard ecotoxicity bioassays, algae were the most susceptible aquatic organisms for selected antibiotics, followed by crustaceans and fish. The risk data suggested that some antibiotics, such as sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), and sulfamethazine (SMZ) pose a great risk to the aquatic system. Based on the present review, it is necessary to strengthen the research into their ecotoxicity to marine systems and the chronic toxicity of antibiotic mixtures.},

	abstract = {Density functional theory calculations are performed on phosphorene quantum dots having different shapes and edge terminations to investigate their structure stability, electronic properties, and gas sensing ability. All the selected phosphorene dots, namely hexagonal and triangular flakes with armchair and zigzag terminations, have positive binding energies which insure their stability even though the bond lengths are much longer than those in the infinite phosphorene layer. It is found that all the selected hydrogen passivated quantum dots have a wide energy gap. In contrast, the partial passivation with sulfur decreases the gap. Moreover, it transforms the system from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic state. The energy gap of hexagonal zigzag cluster can be additionally tuned by electric field: narrowed by about 1.7 eV for hydrogenated or broadened by 0.25 eV for partially sulfurated edges. It is shown that phosphorene quantum dots successfully adsorb H2S, CH4, CO, NH3 gas molecules either on their edge or surface. The highest adsorption energy is obtained for NH3 molecule, when it is placed over the surface. This adsorption is alleviated by in-plane electric field and hindered by perpendicular field.},

	abstract = {Quantum chemical calculations have been performed to investigate the photolysis mechanism of relatively susceptible sulfonamide moiety of five-membered sulfonamide (SA) antibiotics, such as sulfamethoxazole, sulfisoxazole, sulfamethizole, and sulfathiazole. The results show that the ·OH-mediated indirect photolysis of sulfonamide linkage has two possible multi-step reaction pathways, viz., H-abstraction and electrophilic C1-attack, which is contrast to previously reported one-step cleavage manner. The newly proposed indirect photolysis mechanisms could be applied to six-membered SAs such as sulfadimethoxine. It has been found that the dissociation of S–N bond is easier in direct photolysis than ·OH-mediated indirect photolysis. Wiberg bond index and LUMO-HOMO energy gap are investigated to clarify the origin of the discrepant reactivity of sulfonamide moiety of SAs at singlet and triplet states. In comparison with singlet states, the S–N bond of SAs is weaker at triplet states of SAs and thus results in higher reactivity of sulfonamide moiety, as also suggested by smaller LUMO-HOMO energy gap. This study could add better understanding to the photolysis mechanisms of SAs, which would be also helpful in utilizing quantum chemistry calculation to investigate the behavior and fate of antibiotics in the aquatic environment.},

	abstract = {We review the GPAW open-source Python package for electronic structure calculations. GPAW is based on the projector-augmented wave method and can solve the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) equations using three different wave-function representations, namely real-space grids, plane waves, and numerical atomic orbitals. The three representations are complementary and mutually independent and can be connected by transformations via the real-space grid. This multi-basis feature renders GPAW highly versatile and unique among similar codes. By virtue of its modular structure, the GPAW code constitutes an ideal platform for the implementation of new features and methodologies. Moreover, it is well integrated with the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), providing a flexible and dynamic user interface. In addition to ground-state DFT calculations, GPAW supports many-body GW band structures, optical excitations from the Bethe-Salpeter Equation, variational calculations of excited states in molecules and solids via direct optimization, and real-time propagation of the Kohn-Sham equations within time-dependent DFT. A range of more advanced methods to describe magnetic excitations and non-collinear magnetism in solids are also now available. In addition, GPAW can calculate non-linear optical tensors of solids, charged crystal point defects, and much more. Recently, support for graphics processing unit (GPU) acceleration has been achieved with minor modifications to the GPAW code thanks to the CuPy library. We end the review with an outlook, describing some future plans for GPAW.},
